## Welcome to Hardie's GitHub Pages

Just say:
`` Hello word!``  

> Just like markdown and github to build this site and I can put a domain here.

I got two site
+ [MemoriesBar](http://www.huiyibar.com) (a blog about memories)
+ [www.Hardie.me](http://www.hardie.me) (My tech blog)
and onemore doc site 
+ [doc.hardie.me](doc.hardie.me) for publish some manuals,currently for itop only

GitHub is a good place to put your code here and build your own site.
