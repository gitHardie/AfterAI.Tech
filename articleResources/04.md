Although autonomous intelligent systems (AIS) can offer significant benefits, they also can be used unethically. The technology can create <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/real-time-audio-deepfake-vishing" target="_self">deepfakes</a>, realistic-looking altered images and videos that help spread <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-misinformation-llm-bullshit" target="_self">misinformation</a> and disinformation. Meanwhile, AI systems trained on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/inclusive-ai" target="_self">biased data can perpetuate discrimination</a> in hiring, lending, and other practices. And surveillance systems that incorporate AI can lead to misidentification.</p><p>Those issues have led to concerns about AIS trustworthiness, and it has become more crucial for AI developers and companies to ensure the systems they use and sell are ethically sound. To help them, the <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Standards Association</a> (IEEE SA) launched its <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/icap/ieee-certifaied/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE CertifAIEd</a> ethics program, which offers two certifications: one for individuals and one for products.</p><p>IEEE CertifAIEd was developed by an interdisciplinary group of AI ethics experts. The program is based on IEEE’s <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/other/ethical-considerations-ai-as-29mar2018.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AI ethics framework and methodology</a>, centered around the pillars of accountability, privacy, transparency, and avoiding bias. The program incorporates criteria outlined in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2025/06/25/introducing-cc-signals-a-new-social-contract-for-the-age-of-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AI ontological specifications</a> released under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> licenses.</p><p>IEEE is the only international organization that offers the programs, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-labrador-862899395/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jon Labrador</a>, director for conformity assessment of IEEE SA programs.</p><h2>Assessment program details</h2><p>The <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/icap/ieee-certifaied/professional-certification/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">professional certification</a> provides individuals with the skills to assess an AIS for adherence to IEEE’s methodology and ethics framework.</p><p>Those with at least one year of experience in the use of AI tools or systems in their organization’s business processes or work functions are <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/icap/ieee-certifaied/professional-certification/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eligible to apply</a> for the certification.</p><p>You don’t have to be a developer or engineer to benefit from the training, Labrador says. Insurance underwriters, policymakers, human resources personnel, and others could benefit from it, he says.</p><p>“Professionals from just about any industry or any company that’s using an AI tool to process business transactions are eligible for this program,” he says.</p><p>The training program covers how to ensure that AI systems are open and understandable; identify and mitigate biases in algorithms; and protect personal data. The <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/icap/ieee-certifaied/curriculum-licensing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">curriculum</a> includes use cases. Courses are available in virtual, in-person, or self-study formats.</p><p>Learners must take a final exam. Once they’ve successfully passed the test, they’ll receive their three-year IEEE professional certification, which is globally recognized, accepted, and respected, Labrador says.</p><p>“With the certification, you’ll become a trusted source for reviewing AI tools used in your business processes, and you’ll be qualified to run an assessment,” he says. “It would be incumbent on a company to have a few IEEE CertifAIEd professionals to review its tools regularly to make sure they conform with the values identified in our program.”</p><p>The self-study exam preparatory course is available to IEEE members at US $599; it costs $699 for nonmembers.</p><h2>Product assessments</h2><p>The <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/icap/ieee-certifaied/product-certification/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">product certification program</a> assesses whether an organization’s AI tool or AIS conforms to the IEEE framework and continuously aligns with legal and regulatory principles such as the <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Union AI Act</a>.</p><p>An IEEE CertifiAIEd assessor evaluates the product to ensure it meets all criteria. There are <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/icap/ieee-certifaied/product-certification/#certification-registry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 300 authorized assessors</a>.</p><p>Upon completion of the assessment, the company submits it to <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/icap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Conformity Assessment</a>, which certifies the product and issues the certification mark.</p><p>“That mark lets customers know that the company has gone through the rigors and is 100 percent in conformance with the latest IEEE AI ethics specifications,” Labrador says.</p><p>“The IEEE CertifiAIEd program can also be viewed as a risk mitigation tool for companies,” he says, “reducing the risk of system or process failures with the introduction of a new AI tool or system in established business processes.”</p><p>You can <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/icap/ieee-certifaied/product-certification/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">complete an application</a> to begin the process of getting your product certified.</p>
