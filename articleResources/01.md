<p><img alt="Yann LeCun, Meta&#039;s leading AI researcher, does not believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are the way to human-like intelligence. They would have limitations in logic, understanding the physical world, memory, rational reasoning, and hierarchical planning. Instead, LeCun is focusing on developing a &quot;common sense&quot; AI world model that understands the world and then learns to solve tasks efficiently - similar to humans. It could take up to a decade of research to realize this vision, LeCun estimates. Despite the criticism of LLMs, Meta is also investing heavily in their development, releasing a capable open-source model in the form of Llama and implementing it in its own products. A version of Llama 3 has been announced that will outperform OpenAI&#039;s GPT-4." class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" height="1080" src="https://the-decoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Yann-LeCun-Meta.png" style="height: auto; margin-bottom: 10px;" width="1920" /></p>
